<h1>Triangles </h1>
<p>All triangles have three sides and three angles, but they come in many different sizes and shapes. Triangles can be categorized by various properties based on their angles and sides, and understanding these properties allows you to apply the ideas in many real-world problems. The triangle is one of the strongest shapes and hence it is used in construction for its rigidity and stable shape.

<h2>Types of triangle and their classification</h2>

<h3>Types of triangles based on their side length</h3>
<p><strong>Equilateral triangle</strong> triangle is considered to be an <strong><em>equilateral triangle</em></strong> when all three sides have the same length.</p>
<p><strong>Isosceles triangle</strong> two sides of a triangle are equal or congruent, then it is called an <strong><em>isosceles triangle.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Scalene triangle</strong> none of the sides of a triangle are equal, it is called a <strong><em>scalene triangle</em></strong> </p>

<h3>Types of Triangles Based on Angles</h3>
<p><strong>Acute angled triangle</strong> all the angles of a triangle are acute, they measure less than 90°, it is called an <strong><em> acute-angled triangle or acute triangle.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Right angle triangle</strong> one of the angles of the triangle is 90°, it is called a      <strong><em>right-angled triangle or right triangle</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Obtuse angled triangle</strong> one of the angles of a triangle is an obtuse angle, measure greater than 90°, it is called an <strong><em>obtuse-angled triangle or obtuse triangle.</em></strong> </p>
