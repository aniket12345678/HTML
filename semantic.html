    <h1>Web development is divided into 2 parts</h1>
    <h4>Front end</h4>
    <p>The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as
        the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and
        styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the
        languages used for Front End development. The structure, design, behavior, and content of everything seen on
        browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End
        developers. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure
        that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should
        behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.</p>

        </ul>
    </details>
    <h4>Back end</h4>
    <p>Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the
        client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It
        is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics
        developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities,
        like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even
        systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.</p>
